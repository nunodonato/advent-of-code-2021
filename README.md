# Advent of Code 2021
Using Advent of Code to run experiments with AI (Codex and GitHub's Copilot) and prompt engineering.

### Introduction
I was looking for a challenge to get more practice in prompt engineering and Advent of Code was just the right place to start!

My goal? Solve each puzzle successfully without writing any code. The idea was to better understand how to write good prompts in order to achieve the best results. If, in some cases, the AI can't solve the puzzle correctly, I will point out in comments the lines I needed to add or fix.

Each puzzle has it's own file and inputs. Note that the inputs are different for every login in Advent of Code, so don't copy my results :)

I'll be writing some comments and observations each day(or when relevant) on my blog over at https://www.nunodonato.com
